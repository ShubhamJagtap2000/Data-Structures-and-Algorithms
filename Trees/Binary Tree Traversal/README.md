# Tree Traversal

**- Process of visiting each node in the tree exactly once in some order** \
**- Visiting -> Reading/Processing data in a node**

**1. Breadth First Traversal -> Traversal according to level-order from left to right**\
**2. Depth First Traversal -> Complete each subtree along a path left or right**
  - D - L - R (Pre-order)
  - L - D - R (In-order)
  - L - R - D (Post-order)
  - Here, D -> Data, L -> Left, R -> Right
