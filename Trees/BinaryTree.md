# Binary Tree

Let, n be thenumber of nodes in a binary tree

- Each node can have at most 2 children
- If each node has 2 or 0 children then it is callled strict binary tree
- All levels except possibly the last are completely filled and all nodes are as left as possible
- Nodes at same depth can be called nodes at same level
- Maximum depth of a tree is equal to height of the tree
- Max no. of nodes at level i = 2^i
- Perfect binary tree has all the levels completely filled
- Max no. of nodes in a binary tree with height h = 2^(h + 1) - 1 = 2^(no. of levels) - 1
- Heght of perfect binary tree = log(n + 1) - 1 (base = 2)
- Height of complete binary tree = floor(log(n)) (base = 2)
- If the difference between height of left and right subtree for every node is not more than K(mostly 1) is called as Balanced Binary Tree
- Height of an empty tree = -1
- Height of tree with 1 node = 0
- Diference between left and right subtrees of a node = | height of left subtree - height of right subtree |
