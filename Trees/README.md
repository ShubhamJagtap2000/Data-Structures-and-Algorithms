# Tree Data Structure

- Collection of entities called "nodes" linked together to simulate a hierarchy
- Tree is a non-linear data structure. It's a hierarchical data structure
- The topmost node of a tree is called a "root" node
- Each node may contain data or link to some other nodes called its "child" nodes
- Children of same node are called as "sibling"
- Any node that does not have a child is called the "leaf" node
- Nodes with at least one child are called "internal" nodes
- If we can go from node "A" to "B", the A is called "ancestor" of B and B is called "descendent" of A
- Nodes not having same parent but having same grandparent can be called "cousins"
- Tree can be called recursive data structure
- For a tree with "n" nodes there will be exactly "n - 1" links or edges
- Depth of X = Length of the path from root to X OR number of edges in path from root to X
- Height of X = Number of edges in longest path from X to a leaf
- Height of a tree = Height of root node

# Applications:

- Storing hierarchical data
- Organizing data
