# OOP in C++

| Procedural Oriented Programming(POP) | Object Oriented Programming(OOP) |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| List of instructions for a computer to follow | Emphasis on data rather than procedure |
| Group of similar tasks are organized as functions | Programs are divided into objects |
| Most fuctions shared global data | Data structures are designed such that they characterize the objects |
| Data is publicly available | Functions that operate on the data of an object are tied together in the same data structure |

# Definition

- OOP is an approach that provides a way of *moduarizing* programs by creating partitioned memory area for both data and functions that can be used as a *template(Class)* for creating copies of such modules on *demand(Objects)*
- **Some basic concepts in OOP:** 
    1. Classes & Objects
    2. Data Abstraction and Encapsulation
    3. Inheritance
    4. Polymorphism
    5. Dynamic Binding
    6. Message Passing
