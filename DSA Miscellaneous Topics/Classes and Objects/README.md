Object Oriented Programming

Some basic concepts associated with OOP:

1. Classes and Objects
2. Data Abstraction and Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Dynamic Binding
6. Message Passing

**OOP** is an approach that provides a way of modularizing programs by creating partitioned memory area for both data and functions that can be used as **a template(Class)** for creating copies of such **modules on demand(Objects)**
