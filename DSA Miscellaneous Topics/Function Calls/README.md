# Pass/Call by Value vs. Pass/Call by Address vs. Pass/Call by Reference

## 1. Pass by Value

#### **- The call/pass by value method of passing arguments to a function copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function**

#### **- In this case, changes made to the parameter inside th function have no effect on the argument**

#### **- By default, C++ uses call by value to pass arguments. In general, this means that code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function**
