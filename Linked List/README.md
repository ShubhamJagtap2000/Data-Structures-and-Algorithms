# What is Linked List Data Structure?

## Definition

#### A *linked list* is a *linear data structure*, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
#### The elements in a *linked list* are linked using pointers *(entity that points to the next element)*.
#### In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Working of Linked List

### Linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

#### **1. Node/Link/Element/Object:**
##### Each node in a linked list consists of 2 parts:
##### a) Data
##### b) Link to the next node

#### **2. Next:**
##### - This points to the next node/element in the linked list(since they are not stored in a contiguous memory locations)

## Linked List Operations

#### 1. Traversing a linked list
#### 2. Append a new node(to the end) of a linked list
#### 3. Prepend a new node(to start) of linked list
#### 4. Inserting a new node to a specific position in the linked list
#### 5. Deleting a node from the linked list
#### 6. Updating a node in the linked list

## Types of Linked List

#### 1. Singly Linked List
#### 2. Doubly Linked List
#### 3. Circular Linked List

## Applications of Linked List Data Structures

#### Implementing stacks, queues
#### Used to implement graphs
#### Implementing Hash tables
#### Undo functionality in Photoshop or Word
